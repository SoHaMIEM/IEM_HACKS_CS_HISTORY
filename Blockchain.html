            <h2>History of Blockchain Technology </h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                The history of blockchain began with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008 by an<br>
                 individual or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. This marked the birth<br>
                  of blockchain technology, a decentralized digital ledger. Over time, the concept<br>
                   extended beyond cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum introducing smart contracts in 2015, <br>
                   enabling the creation of decentralized applications.<br>
                    As industries recognized its potential, blockchain found applications in supply chain management,<br>
                     healthcare, and more. Challenges such as scalability and energy consumption<br>
                      prompted the exploration of new consensus mechanisms.<br>
                       Today, blockchain continues to evolve, with ongoing innovation driving its integration <br>
                       into diverse sectors for enhanced security and transparency.</p>
