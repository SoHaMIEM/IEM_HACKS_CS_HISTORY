            <p>
                Cybersecurity provides protection to our digital world against evolving threats.<br>
                It safeguards sensitive information, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures the <br>
                smooth functioning of critical systems. Beginning with defending against malicious<br>
                software and data leaks, it extends to countering organized cyberattacks and <br>
                ransomware threats in the realm of communication security.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of CybSec</h2>
            <p>The evolution of cybersecurity has been marked by swift adaptations to escalating </p>
            <p>digital threats. Starting with basic firewalls and antivirus tools, it progressed </p>
            <p>to encompass encryption, intrusion detection, and AI-driven defense mechanisms. As </p>
            <p>attacks became more sophisticated, cybersecurity embraced behavioral analytics and </p>
            <p>threat intelligence, fortifying itself against an ever-evolving threat landscape.</p>
