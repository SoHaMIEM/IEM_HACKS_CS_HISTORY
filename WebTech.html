            <h2>History of Web Technology</h2>
            <p>Web technology forms the backbone of our digital world, encompassing the tools, languages,<br>
                and protocols that enable the creation, delivery, and interaction with content on the internet.</p>
            <p>
                The history of web technology is a journey marked by significant milestones.<br>
                 Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web in 1989 laid the foundation, <br>
                 allowing documents to be linked across a network. The 1990s witnessed the development <br>
                 of HTML for content structure and HTTP for communication. The emergence of CSS in the<br>
                  late '90s introduced styling capabilities, while JavaScript revolutionized interactivity.<br>
                   The 2000s brought dynamic web applications with AJAX, and later, responsive design to<br>
                    adapt to various devices. Today, web technology continues evolving, incorporating APIs,<br>
                     frameworks like React and Angular, and pushing the boundaries of user experience and interconnectivity.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of Web Technology</h2>
            <p>
                The evolution of web technology has been a dynamic process, shaping the digital<br>
                landscape from its inception to the present day. Beginning with static HTML pages<br>
                in the early 1990s, the introduction of CSS allowed for better design control.<br>
                The late '90s brought JavaScript for interactivity,<br>
                 paving the way for dynamic web content. The 2000s saw the rise of AJAX for seamless data exchange,<br>
                  followed by the proliferation of mobile-responsive design.<br>
                   With the 2010s came the dominance of web applications using<br>
                    frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js. Today, the web<br>
                     continues to evolve with the advent of progressive web apps,<br>
                      AI integration, and the exploration of Web 3.0 technologies like blockchain and decentralized platforms.
